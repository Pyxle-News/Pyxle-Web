                            Recently, Intel has entered the GPU market with its Intel Arc series of graphics processing
                            units (GPUs). These GPUs are designed to provide high performance and energy efficiency for
                            a variety of applications, from gaming and video editing to machine learning and scientific
                            research, but at a digestible price point.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The Intel Arc GPUs are also built on the Xe architecture, which is designed to scale from
                            the low-power mobile devices to the high-performance data centre. The Xe architecture allows
                            for the use of a common software stack across all devices, making it easy for developers to
                            create applications that can run on a wide range of hardware. They target the mid-range
                            market for cost effective PC builds in the face of companies such as Nvidia and AMD
                            proposing extortionate amounts of money for their mid-range GPUs, including the 4070 Ti
                            which has launched at an eye watering £800. Whilst the Arc line up at around £380 may not
                            offer comparable performance, they are a tier above in price to performance, with claims of
                            up to 3080 levels of performance.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Unfortunately, the relatively new arrival of these GPUs has meant that they have been
                            plagued with issues so far. Amongst these, by far the biggest issue is incompatible games,
                            with Intel’s GPU’s only supporting DirectX 11 and 12, (with 11 having already faced severe
                            performance issues), many older titles which rely on DirectX 9 face a crippling performance
                            hit. Similar issues have also been seen in popular games such as Minecraft, with users
                            reporting problems when loading textures, causing the game to look terrible.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            But putting aside the current, looking into the future, should Intel manage to iron out the
                            main issues around the Arc line up with upcoming driver updates, their market penetration
                            could provide a welcome respite from the ever increasing costs in the fight between the two
                            existing GPU giants, providing consumers with a viable, low-cost alternative.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> is an AI chatbot released by OpenAI in late
                            November last year, based off their model GPT-3 used for natural language processing. It has
                            sparked huge interest as its key focus is on generating extremely human-like natural
                            sounding responses - and it does this very well. (Try it out yourself and see).
                            <br /><br />
                            Already, people have been using the site for many things - mostly fun. Realistically,
                            practical applications should use the more general GPT-3 model to get better results, so the
                            AI chatbot only serves to be used for fun. Since it's so good at generating natural-sounding
                            language, people have asked it hilarious prompts such as a debate between <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/100lfn1/shakespearean_duck_debate/">Donald
                                and Daffy Duck in the style of Shakespeare</a>. The AI clearly understands humour, to an
                            extent, such as when asked to write a <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zi95w2/its_messing_with_me_right/">3-line
                                poem</a>. It has also been used to generate <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zj2aeu/1010_mustsee_moment_chatgpt_just_did_something/">clickbaity
                                titles</a> and <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zitw2v/invent_a_new_type_of_color_and_describe_what_it/">new
                                colours</a>...
                            <br /><br />
                            Crucially, the chatbot does not have access to the internet. While this is generally a good
                            idea to allow the bot to run in a controlled environment (and avoid taking over the world),
                            it means it has no way to verify information; if you ask it a question about information
                            after 2021 (when it was trained), it does not know at all, stating
                        <blockquote>my knowledge was cut off in 2021, and I am not able to browse the web or access new
                            information. Can I help you with anything else?</blockquote> Generally, if you ask it for a
                        fact, however, it is often extremely overconfident in its response, even if it's not correct.
                        Like claiming a banana is bigger than a cat. Even though a cat has bigger dimensions. <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/ze7h55/chatgpt_banana_cat/">Really.</a>
                        This is potentially dangerous as it is in some ways better at lying than humans, and can be used
                        to generate trustworthy sounding text which can be used to mislead.
                        <br /><br />
                        So much is this problem that stackoverflow - the (in)famous programming Q&A site - <a
                            href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned">banned
                            the AI</a>, claiming that <blockquote>Overall, because the average rate of getting correct
                            answers from ChatGPT is too low, <em>the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is
                                <i>substantially harmful</i> to the site and to users who are asking and looking for
                                correct answers.</em></blockquote> People, potentially well-meaning, had been looking to
                        help out on questions extremely fast - by asking ChatGPT - and copy-pasting the response without
                        checking its truth, leading to misinformation spreading through the site.
                        <br /><br />
                        While the ban is great in theory, it's not that easy to detect - or wasn't, until <a
                            href="https://gptzero.substack.com/">GPTZero</a> arrived at the beginning of the year. It
                        has already received over 7 million views and can detect ChatGPT's writing style - using the
                        same technology that ChatGPT is built upon. It measures "perplexity" of the text - how random it
                        is. Humans tend to have a much higher score of perplexity, and the tool gives you statistical
                        information on the perplexity of sentences in the text before giving its verdict. This could be
                        very useful for stopping ai-plagiarism in education. "Plagiarism" of AI has been a controversial
                        subject recently, specifically pertaining to AI art, such as <a
                            href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">Dall-E 2</a> (also by OpenAI). While the art looks a lot
                        fantastic, several questions are under debate - whether the prompter or the AI made it, for a
                        start; and also the ethics of the training data used for the AI: should all artists whose images
                        were trained on be credited?
                        <br /><br />
                        ChatGPT is a showcase of great advancements in natural language AI, which has come extremely far
                        from when Alan Turing created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Imitation
                            Game</a> (aka Turing Test), to <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman">Eugene Goostman</a> passing it and
                        developing much more since then. However, many ethical issues arise from it that do need to be
                        adressed.
