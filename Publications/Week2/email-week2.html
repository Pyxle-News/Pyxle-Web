                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Recently, Mercedes has started charging users for hardware that is already there on the
                            basis of a monthly subscription. The subscription costs $1200 a year, and has left many in
                            shock. However, this is only the beginning of an - arguably worrying - trend in the
                            automotive industry.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The subscription called “Acceleration Increase” allows the motors in electric Mercedes’ to
                            output 20-24% more and also increasing torque and reducing the time it takes for 0-60 mph
                            acceleration. The subscription does not include any new hardware that gets shipped to you.
                            Rather it just unlocks the capabilities of the car that were already there. As global trends
                            in the industry have shown a decline in the number of new cars that are being bought,
                            automotive manufacturers have started releasing subscriptions that have new software or
                            hardware upgrades to bring in more revenue. From one perspective, it could be argued that
                            this is not something that car producers should be doing, as the hardware is already there.
                            However, from another point of view, this may be important as it allows the company to add
                            hardware to every car, lower the costs, and then asking consumers to pay if they want to use
                            it. This way, you won’t be paying for features you aren’t going to be using.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            This makes sense in the long run. The average person in a city does not need extremely fast
                            acceleration. Especially with all the traffic in most cities these days. The same goes for
                            the other side. A person buying a car for racing does not generally need heated seats (BMW
                            has started charging customers for some features, which include heated seats, in some of
                            their car lineups. Read more here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-62142208) , so why
                            should they pay for it?
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Whether you agree or disagree, this is the direction that the automotive industry has
                            chosen, and there are great transformations coming: this is only the beginning.

                            When Apple released the first iPhone all the way back in 2008, it had no App Store meaning
                            you could not download any of today’s most essential apps, such as Snapchat, Instagram or
                            WhatsApp. Now enter a man named Jay Freeman. In early 2008, he released one of the most
                            revolutionary apps in jailbreaking history: Cydia. Cydia is a package manager which allows
                            users to install, well, packages. These allow the user to install .deb files which modify
                            iOS to their liking. A by-product of this was being able to install apps as well, which in
                            effect, made Cydia the first ever App Store and possibly what also prompted Apple to create
                            an App Store. In fact, several jailbreak “tweaks” over the years have been copied by Apple
                            and added into the main iOS experience. Examples of this include the basics such as Pull to
                            Refresh, the redesigned notifications system from iOS 15, lock screen widgets and even iPad
                            widgets in general.

                            Fast forward to November 2022, a public jailbreak has not been released for over two years
                            and counting. Partially thanks to Apple’s new mitigations which have patched one of the main
                            memory kernel exploits, which jailbreak developers had relied on previously, jailbreak
                            development in general has slowed significantly. But in addition to this, with jailbreaking
                            primarily being done to gain access to additional features and greater customisation, but
                            with the latest jailbreak now being two whole iOS versions behind (only supporting up to iOS
                            14.8), users are actually starting to lose features which are available in the latest iOS 16
                            update. This has prompted many to update and therefore also lose the ability to jailbreak,
                            and unfortunately it is currently predicted that less people than ever before are
                            jailbreaking their devices. Not only this, the developers who work to release these
                            jailbreaks are leaving the scene due to either being bought out by Apple or due to the lack
                            of money in the job. In fact, one of the main jailbreak developers, CoolStar has recently
                            announced their movement away from the jailbreak community, another big loss.

                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            That brings me to the actual title of this article. Is jailbreaking actually dead now? Well,
                            no matter how much the scene may have seemed to slow, new developers (most of whom are
                            actually still in school), have joined the scene, including Nebula, who released the
                            experimental Palera1n jailbreak for checkm8 compatible devices (iPhone 6s - iPhone X)
                            between iOS 15.0 and 15.7.1. In addition to this, all devices between 15.0 and 15.1.1 are
                            also able to use the sideloading tool TrollStore, which is an untethered app that allows the
                            user to install any app via an .ipa file without revokes. These new tools have been
                            incredibly important in driving the community forward. Unfortunately, it is not all good
                            news. Due to mitigations made by Apple, developers are no longer directly able to access the
                            Root File system on iPhones without a long workaround which has not yet been developed. As a
                            result, all the jailbreaks so far are Rootless and this means developers will need to
                            rewrite many tweaks in order to add compatibility.

                            `Iterator` that can give out references - to be available.
