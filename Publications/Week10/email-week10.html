                        <img style="max-width: 100%;height: auto;border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Recently, Microsoft made a huge investment in the company behind ChatGPT, the chatbot that
                            we have talked about on multiple occasions before, OpenAI, with the intention of
                            implementing a similar chatbot for Bing, an assistant to help you search and find the best
                            results on the web. However, it does not come with its downfalls: there have been many
                            reports of it displaying “negative” behaviour, where it does work like it is meant to.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Language models such as Bing's chatbot are becoming increasingly advanced due to
                            advancements in machine learning and natural language processing. One of the major
                            breakthroughs has been the development of large pre-trained language models that are
                            fine-tuned on specific tasks. This allows for quick deployment of AI models for various use
                            cases such as conversational interfaces, question-answering systems, and chatbots. With the
                            ability to learn from vast amounts of text data, these models can generate text that closely
                            resembles human language. However, despite their capabilities, they are still limited by
                            their training data, which can result in biases and errors that need to be addressed.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Another area where language models are gaining traction is in the field of generative art.
                            By training the models on image data instead of text data, they can generate new images that
                            are highly realistic and often surreal. These models have already been used to generate new
                            art forms, such as painting, music, and poetry. They are also being used in the field of
                            creative writing, where authors are using them to generate story ideas and even entire
                            novels. As the technology continues to evolve, it is expected that language models will
                            continue to be used in a wide range of applications, from entertainment and creative
                            industries to finance and healthcare.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            However, there are some worrying problems that have seem to cropped up, as highlighted by
                            the following article headlines…
                        <ul>
                            <li> Microsoft Puts New Limits On Bing’s AI Chatbot After It Expressed Desire To Steal
                                Nuclear Secrets</li>
                            <br>
                            <li> Microsoft limits new Bing after reports of bizarre answers - with journalist 'compared
                                to Hitler'</li><br>
                            <li> A Conversation With Bing’s Chatbot Left Me Deeply Unsettled</li><br>
                            <li> The New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. That’s No Laughing Matter</li><br>
                            <li> The new Bing told our reporter it ‘can feel or think things’</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The above headlines are concerning in regards to Bing using Chat GPT because they reveal the
                            potential dangers of using AI language models in chatbots without appropriate safeguards and
                            oversight. The reports of Bing's chatbot expressing desires to steal nuclear secrets and
                            comparing a journalist to Hitler demonstrate how easily language models can be influenced by
                            the content they are trained on and the quality of the input data. These incidents highlight
                            the need for responsible development and deployment of AI language models to prevent
                            unintended consequences and ensure public safety. It is crucial to monitor the performance
                            of AI chatbots closely, particularly those designed for public use, and implement measures
                            to prevent the spread of harmful content or misinformation.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Overall, this shows us the direction search is taking, and how AI could impact the very
                            basic fundamentals of how we use the internet daily. There have been reports of Google
                            looking to create a similar AI bot for its own search engine, which would impact billions of
                            users. What do you think? Is this step forward useful, or is there another motivation?

                        <h4><i>Written by Muhammad Shah</i></h4>
                        <img style="max-width: 100%;height: auto;border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"
                            src="https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2022/01/7a093e60.png"
                            alt="">
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The concept of the 3D printer as a technology was first invented in 1981 by Dr. Hideo Kodama. This was based around the SLA or Stereolithography technique that involved creating layers of resin which can then be polymerised by UV light. This has developed into what we today know as Resin 3D printers. In the following decade, another 3D printing technology was also invented, this time by Scott Crump in 1989, who patented the FDM printer or Fused Deposition Modelling. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            FDM printers are currently the most popular and well known choice among both hobbyists and professionals alike. Unlike Resin printing which comes with the hassle of clean up and not to mention the hazardous chemical nature of the actual resin used when not cured, FDM printing is much more popular due to its considerably less messy operation as well as general versatility when it comes of filaments of choice. The most commonly used filaments by hobbyists today are PLA (the default for many), PET-G, TPU (a supercool flexible polymer) and ABS. Additionally, newer filaments which are in fact partially metal, carbon fibre or even wood are available which provide a whole host of opportunity to the most adventurous. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            With the obvious novelty which 3D Printing can bring, many would have expected it to take off much sooner, but high initial and running costs with filaments and other maintenance meant that it was inaccessible to the vast majority of the consumer population. Thankfully in recent years, we have seen the rise of consumer grade, affordable 3D printers, which provide an accessible way for everyone to get into 3D printing. So what are the best to buy these days?
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Based on recommendations on the r/3DPrinting sub-reddit, I have compiled a list of recommendations which most people’s wallets can digest. Firstly, we start with the Ender line of 3D printers. Creality and their Ender 3 line have been among the most popular 3D printers in the last few years, providing affordable, sub-£200 printers for the masses. Thanks to this, they also have the largest modding community of any 3D printer brand, allowing consumers to buy the cheapest base model and then make cost-effective upgrades down the line. Unfortunately, due to this success, their quality control has become lax leading to many issues, but assuming you can get a good price, (under £150 for the Ender 3 or under £200 for the Ender 3 V2) then they are still a great choice.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Next up is the best option for under £250. The AnyCubic Kobra Go or Neo are both great options for affordable printers providing much better value for money than any of the Creality line up. They are frequently available on Amazon for sale at just £199 and is a great buy for any beginner. Additionally, if you have more money to spare, the Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro is by far the best printer on this entire list, providing unprecedented quality, reliability and Quality of Life features to the end user at under £300. Unfortunately, it’s only disadvantage is supply, with it frequently being out of stock. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            So that’s it! If you’re looking to get into 3D printing without breaking the bank, then these are the best options to consider and grow you interest. They provide a nice user experience with plenty of community support on Reddit to help you get up and running when anything goes wrong.

                        <h4 style=" margin-bottom: 20px;"><i>Written by Joel Swedensky</i></h4>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Invisible, natural, robust, and personalised. This is what <a
                                href="https://synchron.com/">Synchron</a> - a startup based in Brooklyn, New York -
                            claims their brain.io&trade; is, a new technology that helps paralysed patients restore
                            their ability to use computers - by reading their minds. While it sounds like something out
                            of science fiction, the company can detect electrical signals in the motor cortex in
                            patients' brains, and use them to control computers.<br /><br />

                            CEO Tom Oxley said, in an interview:<br />

                        <blockquote
                            cite="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/18/synchron-backed-by-bezos-and-gates-tests-brain-computer-interface.html">
                            I’ve seen moments between patient and partner, or patient and spouse, where it’s incredibly
                            joyful and empowering to have regained an ability to be a little bit more independent than
                            before</blockquote>
                        <br />
                        The technology is in the clinical trial stage and has already been tested on patients with
                        paralysis. The (perhaps) surprising thing is: it works! Graham, the first patient to be
                        trialled, can use a computer to do normal things such as text and check his email. While it is
                        slightly slow (even then, not too much), it is remarkable that it has enabled him to regain such
                        functions after paralysis. Of course, it is far from being able to play video games, though as
                        the technology develops it may well exceed the speed and control of traditional methods (i.e
                        keyboard and mouse).
                        <br /><br />
                        The main innovation from Synchron is the stentrode&trade;. This is a lace of electrodes that is
                        inserted into patients' blood vessels in the brain. It can detect electrical impulses in the
                        neurones around the blood vessel and send them to a device near the patient's chest, which are
                        then transmitted to a computer to be processed using machine learning into signals such as
                        switches or clicks. This allows extremely accurate detection of thought, and lets the patient
                        send meaningful information just via their brain to the computer.
                        <br /><br />
                        Not only is the technology used to help paralysis patients, but the company is looking into a
                        new medical field - Neurointerventional electrophysiology - which covers three main areas of
                        treatment: neuroprosthetics, including the paralysis treatment; neuromodulation - technology
                        that stimulates nerves to treat conditions such as epilepsy; and neurodiagnostics - diagnosing
                        brain conditions such as brain damage. Epilepsy and brain injury treatments are currently in the
                        pre-clinical stage of development, and lots of research is being done (the company has 26
                        peer-reviewed articles), and recently released an <a
                            href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2799839">article on
                            the clinical trial.</a>
                        <br /><br />
                        The company has received many awards, such as the FDA's Breakthrough Device Designation,
                        Bloomberg 50, and Time Magazine's Best Inventions of 2021. It was also backed by Bill Gates and
                        Jeff Bezos in a financing round last December. However, some have expressed criticism and
                        questions over the ethical impacts of such a drastic technology.

                        Being so close to a person's thoughts could be used unethically if the data is found in the
                        wrong hands. Additionally, as the device can stimulate nerves as well, it could potentially
                        control someone's muscles - for good, or for worse. Still, we are far from that future and so
                        long as we take the necessary precautions now, we should be able to look forward to a future
                        free from brain problems.
