                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Matter and Thread are two new technologies that are revolutionizing the way we interact with
                            smart devices in our homes. They are designed to make it easier for consumers to control and
                            automate the devices in their homes, and are poised to become a major player in the smart
                            home market.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Matter is a new smart home platform that is being developed by the consortium of industry
                            leaders including Google, Amazon, and the Zigbee Alliance. The platform is based on open
                            standards and is designed to allow smart devices from different manufacturers to work
                            together seamlessly. This will eliminate the need for multiple apps and hubs, making it
                            easier for consumers to control their devices and create automations.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Thread is a new low-power, secure, and scalable network protocol that is being developed by
                            the Thread Group. It is designed to work with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and will
                            provide a secure and reliable way to connect devices to the Internet. This will make it
                            easier for consumers to control their devices from anywhere in the world, and will also make
                            it easier for manufacturers to create new and innovative products.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Together, Matter and Thread are changing the smart home landscape and are poised to become
                            the standard for the industry. They are designed to make it easier for consumers to control
                            their devices, and to make it easier for manufacturers to create new products. This will
                            lead to a more seamless and integrated smart home experience, and will make it easier for
                            consumers to enjoy the benefits of smart devices in their homes.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            There are already several devices that have received confirmation of receiving support via
                            updates in the future. These include the Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, and the Nest Wifi,
                            as well as several other popular devices from other manufacturers. This support is expected
                            to be rolled out over the next few months, and will make it easier for consumers to control
                            their devices and create automations.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            In conclusion, Matter and Thread are two new technologies that are poised to revolutionize
                            the way we interact with smart devices in our homes. They are designed to make it easier for
                            consumers to control their devices and create automations, and are expected to become the
                            standard for the industry. With support already confirmed for several popular devices, it is
                            clear that Matter and Thread are the future of the smart home.

                        <h2>Facebook’s parent company, Meta, gains rights to acquire another VR startup.</h2>
                        <h4><i>Written by Rayan Nadeem</i></h4>
                        <img style="max-width: 100%;height: auto;border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            A California judge has allowed Meta, formerly known as Facebook, to proceed with its
                            acquisition of virtual reality fitness start-up Within, despite a pending antitrust case
                            brought forward by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC had sued Meta in July 2022,
                            arguing that the acquisition of Within, the maker of the popular VR app Supernatural, would
                            expand Meta's dominance in the consumer VR market. The FTC also cited Meta's previous merger
                            with the company behind Beat Saber, claiming that the addition of Within would eliminate a
                            “beneficial rivalry” between the two companies.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            However, the court denied the FTC's request to block the deal, giving the FTC one week to
                            appeal. In December, Meta agreed to delay its acquisition of Within until January 31st. The
                            court's ruling stated that as a VR platform developer, Meta can enjoy the benefits of VR
                            fitness growth without itself intervening in the VR fitness app market. The FTC's pursuit of
                            the case stands in stark contrast to Meta's previous acquisitions, including its purchase of
                            VR start-up Oculus in 2014.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The FTC's internal disagreements and the court's decision to allow the Meta-Within
                            acquisition could indicate an uphill battle for the FTC to limit tech industry
                            consolidation, despite persistent attempts to give antitrust watchdogs more power. If the
                            court's order stands, it would represent a loss for FTC head and antitrust crusader Lina
                            Khan, especially as the FTC is also fighting to stop Microsoft's acquisition of Activision.
                            The two cases differ, particularly in the small size of the VR market compared to the
                            overall games industry and the FTC's focus on the market for fitness VR apps in the Within
                            case, not VR or games in general.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Firstly, this is a really important case as it signifies how large companies often swallow
                            up smaller ones, and Meta is not an exception. Rather it has led by example: in 2012, it
                            acquired what would go on to be one of the world’s largest social media platforms, i.e.
                            Instagram. In 2014, it acquired Oculus, the world’s leading provider of consumer VR
                            headsets, with the Oculus Quest 2 being its latest device. Other companies that have been
                            known to “swallow” up smaller firms include Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google’s parent
                            company) etc. By acquiring these companies, they are reducing competition and bringing their
                            customers to them. Furthermore, it also gives them access to cutting edge research that they
                            would like to incorporate into their own products.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            But why is this important? Well, Meta has been trying to lead development for the
                            “metaverse”, and even named itself after it to emphasise their efforts. By eating up the
                            competition, they are building themselves a nice monopoly, making sure the future is based
                            on their efforts, kind of like the base of the metaverse. Through this, they are not only
                            able to secure their future as a company, but also make sure they’re dominating the tech in
                            the coming years.

                            What do you think? Does this acquisition spell doom, or is it more good-willed than it

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> is an AI chatbot released by OpenAI in late
                            November last year, based off their model GPT-3 used for natural language processing. It has
                            sparked huge interest as its key focus is on generating extremely human-like natural
                            sounding responses - and it does this very well. (Try it out yourself and see).
                            <br /><br />
                            Already, people have been using the site for many things - mostly fun. Realistically,
                            practical applications should use the more general GPT-3 model to get better results, so the
                            AI chatbot only serves to be used for fun. Since it's so good at generating natural-sounding
                            language, people have asked it hilarious prompts such as a debate between <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/100lfn1/shakespearean_duck_debate/">Donald
                                and Daffy Duck in the style of Shakespeare</a>. The AI clearly understands humour, to an
                            extent, such as when asked to write a <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zi95w2/its_messing_with_me_right/">3-line
                                poem</a>. It has also been used to generate <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zj2aeu/1010_mustsee_moment_chatgpt_just_did_something/">clickbaity
                                titles</a> and <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zitw2v/invent_a_new_type_of_color_and_describe_what_it/">new
                                colours</a>...
                            <br /><br />
                            Crucially, the chatbot does not have access to the internet. While this is generally a good
                            idea to allow the bot to run in a controlled environment (and avoid taking over the world),
                            it means it has no way to verify information; if you ask it a question about information
                            after 2021 (when it was trained), it does not know at all, stating
                        <blockquote>my knowledge was cut off in 2021, and I am not able to browse the web or access new
                            information. Can I help you with anything else?</blockquote> Generally, if you ask it for a
                        fact, however, it is often extremely overconfident in its response, even if it's not correct.
                        Like claiming a banana is bigger than a cat. Even though a cat has bigger dimensions. <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/ze7h55/chatgpt_banana_cat/">Really.</a>
                        This is potentially dangerous as it is in some ways better at lying than humans, and can be used
                        to generate trustworthy sounding text which can be used to mislead.
                        <br /><br />
                        So much is this problem that stackoverflow - the (in)famous programming Q&A site - <a
                            href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned">banned
                            the AI</a>, claiming that <blockquote>Overall, because the average rate of getting correct
                            answers from ChatGPT is too low, <em>the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is
                                <i>substantially harmful</i> to the site and to users who are asking and looking for
                                correct answers.</em></blockquote> People, potentially well-meaning, had been looking to
                        help out on questions extremely fast - by asking ChatGPT - and copy-pasting the response without
                        checking its truth, leading to misinformation spreading through the site.
                        <br /><br />
                        While the ban is great in theory, it's not that easy to detect - or wasn't, until <a
                            href="https://gptzero.substack.com/">GPTZero</a> arrived at the beginning of the year. It
                        has already received over 7 million views and can detect ChatGPT's writing style - using the
                        same technology that ChatGPT is built upon. It measures "perplexity" of the text - how random it
                        is. Humans tend to have a much higher score of perplexity, and the tool gives you statistical
                        information on the perplexity of sentences in the text before giving its verdict. This could be
                        very useful for stopping ai-plagiarism in education. "Plagiarism" of AI has been a controversial
                        subject recently, specifically pertaining to AI art, such as <a
                            href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">Dall-E 2</a> (also by OpenAI). While the art looks a lot
                        fantastic, several questions are under debate - whether the prompter or the AI made it, for a
                        start; and also the ethics of the training data used for the AI: should all artists whose images
                        were trained on be credited?
                        <br /><br />
                        ChatGPT is a showcase of great advancements in natural language AI, which has come extremely far
                        from when Alan Turing created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Imitation
                            Game</a> (aka Turing Test), to <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman">Eugene Goostman</a> passing it and
                        developing much more since then. However, many ethical issues arise from it that do need to be
                        adressed.
