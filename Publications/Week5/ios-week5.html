                            Apple's iMessage and Google's Rich Communication Services (RCS) are both messaging platforms
                            that aim to improve upon traditional SMS texting. However, the two platforms have struggled
                            to work together and have caused frustration for users who switch between Apple and Android
                            devices.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            One of the main differences between iMessage and RCS is that iMessage is proprietary and
                            only works within the Apple ecosystem, while RCS is an open standard that is supported by
                            many carriers and device manufacturers. This means that iMessage can only be used by Apple
                            devices, while RCS is avaliable on most Android phones.


                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The conflict between iMessage and RCS highlights the ongoing tensions between Apple and
                            Google in the messaging space. While both companies are attempting to improve upon
                            traditional SMS texting, they are doing so in different ways and with different goals in
                            mind. For Apple, iMessage is a key part of the ecosystem and is tightly integrated with
                            other services such as FaceTime and Apple Music. It is also a way for Apple to keep users
                            within
                            its ecosystem, as it makes it more difficult for users to switch to a different platform.


                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Google, on the other hand, is trying to create a more open and universal messaging platform
                            with RCS. It is working with carriers and device manufacturers to try and get RCS adopted as
                            a standard and in the last few years, this movement has seen significant traction. This
                            leaves Apple
                            as being Google's last major hurdle. Unfortunately, it is unlikely to see Apple conforming
                            willingly
                            any time soon. Should Apple agree to join the RCS messaging standard, one of the biggest
                            reasons
                            that customers are drawn to the iPhone would be suddenly taken away, having an immediate
                            impact on
                            their sales.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Unsurprisingly, Google is also being quite stubborn, having recently launching another
                            flurry
                            of ad campaigns directed at Apple. This is in line with the currently ongoing CES 2023 Tech
                            show where
                            almost all of Big Tech (aside from Apple) gather to showcase their latest advances. It is
                            still unclear
                            whether this battle between the two tech giants will eventually yield in a better user
                            experience, but
                            it can be said for certain that Apple will continue to use iMessage as a key part of their
                            marketing
                            to steal customers away from Android.

                            <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> is an AI chatbot released by OpenAI in late
                            November last year, based off their model GPT-3 used for natural language processing. It has
                            sparked huge interest as its key focus is on generating extremely human-like natural
                            sounding responses - and it does this very well. (Try it out yourself and see).
                            <br /><br />
                            Already, people have been using the site for many things - mostly fun. Realistically,
                            practical applications should use the more general GPT-3 model to get better results, so the
                            AI chatbot only serves to be used for fun. Since it's so good at generating natural-sounding
                            language, people have asked it hilarious prompts such as a debate between <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/100lfn1/shakespearean_duck_debate/">Donald
                                and Daffy Duck in the style of Shakespeare</a>. The AI clearly understands humour, to an
                            extent, such as when asked to write a <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zi95w2/its_messing_with_me_right/">3-line
                                poem</a>. It has also been used to generate <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zj2aeu/1010_mustsee_moment_chatgpt_just_did_something/">clickbaity
                                titles</a> and <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zitw2v/invent_a_new_type_of_color_and_describe_what_it/">new
                                colours</a>...
                            <br /><br />
                            Crucially, the chatbot does not have access to the internet. While this is generally a good
                            idea to allow the bot to run in a controlled environment (and avoid taking over the world),
                            it means it has no way to verify information; if you ask it a question about information
                            after 2021 (when it was trained), it does not know at all, stating
                        <blockquote>my knowledge was cut off in 2021, and I am not able to browse the web or access new
                            information. Can I help you with anything else?</blockquote> Generally, if you ask it for a
                        fact, however, it is often extremely overconfident in its response, even if it's not correct.
                        Like claiming a banana is bigger than a cat. Even though a cat has bigger dimensions. <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/ze7h55/chatgpt_banana_cat/">Really.</a>
                        This is potentially dangerous as it is in some ways better at lying than humans, and can be used
                        to generate trustworthy sounding text which can be used to mislead.
                        <br /><br />
                        So much is this problem that stackoverflow - the (in)famous programming Q&A site - <a
                            href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned">banned
                            the AI</a>, claiming that <blockquote>Overall, because the average rate of getting correct
                            answers from ChatGPT is too low, <em>the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is
                                <i>substantially harmful</i> to the site and to users who are asking and looking for
                                correct answers.</em></blockquote> People, potentially well-meaning, had been looking to
                        help out on questions extremely fast - by asking ChatGPT - and copy-pasting the response without
                        checking its truth, leading to misinformation spreading through the site.
                        <br /><br />
                        While the ban is great in theory, it's not that easy to detect - or wasn't, until <a
                            href="https://gptzero.substack.com/">GPTZero</a> arrived at the beginning of the year. It
                        has already received over 7 million views and can detect ChatGPT's writing style - using the
                        same technology that ChatGPT is built upon. It measures "perplexity" of the text - how random it
                        is. Humans tend to have a much higher score of perplexity, and the tool gives you statistical
                        information on the perplexity of sentences in the text before giving its verdict. This could be
                        very useful for stopping ai-plagiarism in education. "Plagiarism" of AI has been a controversial
                        subject recently, specifically pertaining to AI art, such as <a
                            href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">Dall-E 2</a> (also by OpenAI). While the art looks a lot
                        fantastic, several questions are under debate - whether the prompter or the AI made it, for a
                        start; and also the ethics of the training data used for the AI: should all artists whose images
                        were trained on be credited?
                        <br /><br />
                        ChatGPT is a showcase of great advancements in natural language AI, which has come extremely far
                        from when Alan Turing created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Imitation
                            Game</a> (aka Turing Test), to <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman">Eugene Goostman</a> passing it and
                        developing much more since then. However, many ethical issues arise from it that do need to be
                        adressed.
