                        <h2>Tesla Accused of Violating National Labor Laws by NLRB.</h2>

                            The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed a complaint against Tesla, accusing the company of violating national labor laws. The complaint alleges that Tesla instructed employees at its Orlando, Florida location not to discuss pay or working conditions with higher level managers or with other employees. The company is also accused of instructing employees not to discuss the hiring, suspension, or termination of other employees. These incidents are alleged to have occurred between December 2021 and January 2022 and are said to violate laws that prevent companies from "interfering with, restraining and coercing employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed" by the NLRB Act. A judge will hear arguments related to the complaint in February. This is not the first time the NLRB has taken action against Tesla. In the past, the agency has ruled that Tesla's dress code policy is unlawful for banning clothing with union logos and forced CEO Elon Musk to delete an anti-union tweet. The NLRB has also ruled that the firing of union activist Richard Ortiz was illegal. Recently, two California-based Tesla employees filed complaints with the NLRB over allegations that the company illegally fired them for criticizing Musk.

                            If the NLRB determines that Tesla did indeed violate national labor laws, it could result in serious consequences for the company. Depending on the severity of the violations, the NLRB may order Tesla to reinstate any employees who were wrongfully terminated and provide them with back pay. The company could also be required to post notices acknowledging the violations and promising not to engage in such behavior in the future. In addition, Tesla may face fines and other penalties. It is worth noting that companies found to have violated labor laws often face reputational damage, which can lead to negative consequences such as a decline in stock price and difficulty attracting top talent. It is important for companies to ensure that they are in compliance with labor laws, as failure to do so can have significant and lasting consequences.

                            However, considering Tesla and the recent (and arguably ongoing) drama behind the acquisition of Twitter by Tesla CEO, Elon Musk (read more in our recent article: <a href="https://news.pyxle.ml/Publications/Week1/web-week1.html">https://news.pyxle.ml/Publications/Week1/web-week1.html</a>), this may not ending up having such a significant impact on the company’s reputation as some might argue.

                            The Raspberry Pi is a popular low-cost, high-performance single-board computer that has a
                            wide range of uses, from educational to industrial. They can particularly be spotted in the
                            wild at places such as airports, supermarket tills and train stations, often used to drive
                            displays to provide useful information. Recently, however, there has been a shortage of
                            Raspberry Pi devices, causing frustration and concern among users and organizations that
                            rely on them.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            One of the main causes of the Raspberry Pi shortage is the global semiconductor shortage,
                            which has affected a wide range of industries and devices. The demand for these components
                            has skyrocketed in recent years due to the increase in the use of electronic devices and the
                            growth of the internet of things (IoT).

                            To meet this demand, semiconductor manufacturers have ramped up production, but the process
                            of making semiconductors is complex and time-consuming, so it is difficult to quickly
                            increase supply. Making matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains and
                            caused delays in the production and transportation of these components. As a result, there
                            has been a shortage of semiconductors, which has led to a shortage of devices that use them,
                            including the Raspberry Pi.


                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            It is unclear when the Raspberry Pi shortage will end, as it is dependent on the resolution
                            of the global semiconductor shortage. In the meantime, users and organizations that rely on
                            the Raspberry Pi may have to look for alternative solutions or wait until the devices become
                            more readily available.

                            Luckily, other manufacturers have seen an opportunity in the current Pi shortage, with
                            compelling alternatives coming to market. These include ASUS’s Tinkerboard which aims to use
                            the same footprint as the original Pi 4B. The Orange Pi, Banana Pi and Nano Pi line ups
                            respectively all provide similar low cost alternatives, with some even featuring more
                            powerful hardware and greater capabilities. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost, as in
                            comparison to the Raspberry Pi, community support for IoT projects is limited and so is that
                            for accessories such as displays.

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            In response to this shortage, hobbyists who refuse to give up on the hopes on finding their
                            very own Pi have created a global stock website <a
                                href=”https://rpilocator.com”>https://rpilocator.com</a> which provides realtime updates
                            on availability across the globe. At the time of writing this article, there is not a single
                            brand new Raspberry Pi 4B for sale from a reputable seller in the UK which simply goes to
                            show the sheer scale of this crisis. We can but hope that it will be over soon.
