                            With Elon’s recent acquisition of twitter, there have been many changes to the platform.
                            However, the two most significant so far have been the downsizing of the comapny and the
                            introduction of paid verification a.k.a. the “blue check mark”.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The downscaling of the company caused a outcry amongst Twitter users, yet many saw it as
                            necessary, including Mr. Musk himself. He said “there is no choice when the company is
                            losing over $4M/day” on the platform earlier this month. However, many were still enranged,
                            especially over the short notice many employees were given and the seemingly random choices
                            on who to keep and who to let go - “It’s really a coin flip for everyone at this point” said
                            Twitter employee Simon Balmain whilst talking to the BBC.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The introduction of paid verifcation on the platform was also very controversial, with many
                            taking to the platform to voice their concerns for the future of Twitter. A popular view was
                            that it would lead to an increase of fake and “scammy” accounts as the blue badge would no
                            longer hold as much value. The other side of the debate had a more understanding point of
                            view on the matter, saying that they knew where Musk was coming from on this. As the company
                            was no longer in a profitable state, the paid verification system would bring in alot of
                            much-needed revenue for the company.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            It is obvious that there are many changes still to come to one of the world’s most popular
                            social media platforms. Whether they are for the better or for the worse, that is anyone’s
                            guess. What do you think? Is Twitter falling down a rabbit hole of free speech, or is there
                            more to this than meets the eye?

                        <h2>Hackintosh: An introduction</h2>
                        <h4><i>Written by Muhammad Shah</i></h4>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The word “hackintosh” defines running MacOS on hardware which Apple itself has not designed
                            for it to be run on, i.e. on anything other than Apple devices. Yet for those who choose to
                            go down this painstakingly slow path, the end yields something incredible, which still
                            amazes many even though it has been alive for over two decades.

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            To clear up any legalities, it is not illegal to build your own hackintosh, although certain
                            parts of the process require utmost care to ensure you stay on the safe side of the law.
                            What is illegal is mass producing hackintoshes and then selling them to unsuspecting
                            customers, as Psystar found out in 2008. They were sued by Apple for $2.7 million for
                            illegally distributing copies of MacOS which they have no right to. Luckily for us, the
                            average hackintosh user has Apple on their side, funnily enough. All the OS images used in
                            today’s hackintoshing era actually come from Apple itself, which ensures that (at least for
                            personal use) there are really nothing to be too worried about.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <img style="width: 300px;height: auto;float: left;margin: 10px;margin-right: 10px;border-radius: 10px;"
                                src="https://www.nicksherlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/choose-macos-1024x929.png"
                                alt="">


                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Until about 2018, the dominating figure in the hackintoshing community was the Clover
                            bootloader. A bootloader is basically a computer program which is responsible for loading
                            all the necessary OS data into the main memory, in the correct order. Clover basically
                            allowed the user to customise their bootloader to their hardware and effectively tell MacOS
                            that “I am a mac”. MacOS drivers known as kexts are widely available thanks to the work of
                            opensource developers which aim to give functionality to otherwise unsupported hardware in
                            MacOS.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Since 2018, the new kid on the block, OpenCore, has taken the scene by storm. It promises
                            faster loading speeds, increased reliability and simpler setup. The hackintoshing community
                            was and still is thriving thanks to it. In recent years, more and more people have begun to
                            see hackintoshing as a feasible, customisable alternative to buying a Mac, with many even
                            using it for their daily work devices. Another advantage is the ability to boot multiple
                            OSes as the hardware isn’t locked down for support by Apple, so in many cases, users are
                            able to achieve triple boots, having a machine which is capable of running Linux, Windows
                            and MacOS, something incredibly powerful for developers. But by far the biggest advantage of
                            a hackintosh is simply the cheaper cost over buying a Mac. Almost any 10th generation intel
                            laptop and desktop or below can at the very least boot into MacOS and thanks to extensive
                            work from developers, have full support for all hardware. For example, here is my HP
                            Pavilion x360, a 10th gen i3 which I have upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and an NVME SSD. I am
                            currently able to use all of my hardware except the microphone and HDMI (which isn’t really
                            a big deal). Such support for even the lowest end hardware makes it incredibly accessible to
                            anyone who is willing to put in the time to fine tune their configuration.

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">

                            So how do we get started? I will be taking aid here from the Dortania Guide, created by the
                            maintainers of OpenCore.
                            This is an increible resource for the hackintosh community, making it easier than ever to
                            create a custom configuration.
                            The most important step is to know your hardware. Compatibilty with MacOS in terms of
                            laptops is unfortunately limited to
                            those with 10th generation or earlier Intel CPUs. This is most because of GPU accerleration
                            support, as Apple no longer
                            uses Intel CPUs in their Macbooks, with the 2020 Intel Macbooks being the last supported. As
                            a result, the graphics processor
                            on 11th gen Intel CPUs and later in not compatible with MacOS any longer since Apple has not
                            bothered adding the necessary driver
                            for it. As far as Ryzen goes, almost every AMD laptop is going to be incompatible since
                            Apple just does not use AMD APUs.
                            This is not to say there is no hope. The ASUS ROG 14 is somewhat supported thanks to it
                            having a dedicated GPU and a MUX switch
                            which disables the integrated AMD GPU. Unfortunately this is a huge drain on battery life,
                            so it is not really suitable for everyday use.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Desktop users on the otherhand are relatively well supported. Almost all Intel and AMD CPUs
                            will work to boot, but as said before, 11th gen
                            AMD APUs will have no graphics acceleration. Luckily, GPU support is much nicer on desktop,
                            with most PCs with an AMD dedicated GPU
                            (most of the RX5000 series and the RX6500 and above) being able to run flawlessly. NVidia on
                            the otherhand is tricky. The only supported Nvidia
                            GPUs and the 1000 series in below, but if you wish to use a more modern MacOS such as Big
                            Sur or later, a long work around is needed. Even then,
                            some apps and features may not work as expected. As far as other hardware goes, almost
                            everything
                            else will have atleast some functionality, with the exception of Intel based microphones.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            So what sort of experience can you expect? Well, in my own case, MacOS has generally been a
                            significantly
                            better experience than Windows. Battery life on my laptop exceeds 6 hours, whilst on Windows
                            I was averaging
                            only about 4 hours. This is mostly thanks to the features you can unlock in MacOS, including
                            the ability to
                            undervolt or overclock. In windows, the traditional overclocking software, Intel XTU, does
                            not let my
                            CPU's power configurations to be changed as it is not a "K" or "H" model but instead only an
                            i3 1005G1.
                            In MacOS, thanks to two opensource utilites, I was able to unlock this feature. the first
                            being RU.efi allows
                            you to effectively "hack" you BIOS and disable the Overclocking Lock. Whilst editing you
                            BIOS might sound scary,
                            as long as you know what you are doing, it is generally safe. Another tool called
                            VoltageShift now untilises the
                            unlocked BIOS and allows me to adjust the voltage supplied to the CPU. In my case, I reduced
                            this voltage, which
                            might sound counter intuitve. One might expect performace to drop in this case, but in
                            reality, I saw an improvement
                            of around 5%.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The reason for this is that under heavy load, the CPU reaches a max threshold on its
                            frequency, which generates a lot
                            of heat. To protect the internal components from this heat, the CPU automatically throttles
                            to reduce the temperature
                            but this is at the cost of performace, meaning it si only actually running at around 80%.
                            With undervolting, whilst the CPU
                            might only reach around 95% of the original max, the heat output is significantly less (as
                            this is the graph for heat output
                            to power input is a curved quadratic). Therefore, the CPU is actually able to sustain this
                            95% load, which is actually
                            higher than the original 80%. This also has the added benefit of lower power consumption and
                            improved battery life, as I
                            experienced.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Hopefully, this brief intorduction managed to explain in simple terms what the modern
                            Hackintosh scene looks like and which you can expect to
                            experience if you decide to join in on this interesting journey. Without a doubt, there is a
                            lot to learn on the way!
