                            Back in October of 2020, Apple announced the iPhone’s version of MagSafe, a new wireless
                            charging technology which aimed to reduce the hassle involved with traditional wireless
                            charging. Prior to MagSafe, users had to carefully align their phones with the wireless
                            charging mat in order to charge, which took time and often meant that misaligned phones
                            would simply not charge. In addition, this limited the wireless charging speed to around
                            7.5W due to the inefficiency of the design and non-optimal charging position, contributing
                            to problems such as overheating whilst charging.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            MagSafe successfully fixed most of these issues, with users now being able to slap the
                            charger to the back of their phone with an array of magnets helping to align the charger.
                            This also dramatically improved the efficiency of the charging process, which now means that
                            MagSafe users can charge at up to 15W.

                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Now, in a quiet press release, Apple have effectively “opensourced” MagSafe and agreed to
                            allow it to be used in the next-generation QI 2 (pronounced Chi 2) wireless charging
                            standard. This means that even Android phones with the new technology can use MagSafe
                            chargers with the same benefits that iPhone users enjoy. In addition, we can expect to see
                            an influx of new MagSafe compatible accessories for both Android and iPhones.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            But why has Apple suddenly decided to be the industry leader in this? Well, from personal
                            opinion, I believe that this is in relation to the new EU law which wants all devices to
                            have a common USB-C port or some form of wireless charging. It could be that Apple is
                            pushing this new standard as a means to get ahead of the game, potentially in preparation
                            for a port-less iPhone, in order to circumvent EU laws. Whilst it is unlikely that this will
                            be ready for the 2023 iPhone 15, we would very well see a port-less iPhone 16 or 17.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> is an AI chatbot released by OpenAI in late
                            November last year, based off their model GPT-3 used for natural language processing. It has
                            sparked huge interest as its key focus is on generating extremely human-like natural
                            sounding responses - and it does this very well. (Try it out yourself and see).
                            <br /><br />
                            Already, people have been using the site for many things - mostly fun. Realistically,
                            practical applications should use the more general GPT-3 model to get better results, so the
                            AI chatbot only serves to be used for fun. Since it's so good at generating natural-sounding
                            language, people have asked it hilarious prompts such as a debate between <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/100lfn1/shakespearean_duck_debate/">Donald
                                and Daffy Duck in the style of Shakespeare</a>. The AI clearly understands humour, to an
                            extent, such as when asked to write a <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zi95w2/its_messing_with_me_right/">3-line
                                poem</a>. It has also been used to generate <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zj2aeu/1010_mustsee_moment_chatgpt_just_did_something/">clickbaity
                                titles</a> and <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zitw2v/invent_a_new_type_of_color_and_describe_what_it/">new
                                colours</a>...
                            <br /><br />
                            Crucially, the chatbot does not have access to the internet. While this is generally a good
                            idea to allow the bot to run in a controlled environment (and avoid taking over the world),
                            it means it has no way to verify information; if you ask it a question about information
                            after 2021 (when it was trained), it does not know at all, stating
                        <blockquote>my knowledge was cut off in 2021, and I am not able to browse the web or access new
                            information. Can I help you with anything else?</blockquote> Generally, if you ask it for a
                        fact, however, it is often extremely overconfident in its response, even if it's not correct.
                        Like claiming a banana is bigger than a cat. Even though a cat has bigger dimensions. <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/ze7h55/chatgpt_banana_cat/">Really.</a>
                        This is potentially dangerous as it is in some ways better at lying than humans, and can be used
                        to generate trustworthy sounding text which can be used to mislead.
                        <br /><br />
                        So much is this problem that stackoverflow - the (in)famous programming Q&A site - <a
                            href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned">banned
                            the AI</a>, claiming that <blockquote>Overall, because the average rate of getting correct
                            answers from ChatGPT is too low, <em>the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is
                                <i>substantially harmful</i> to the site and to users who are asking and looking for
                                correct answers.</em></blockquote> People, potentially well-meaning, had been looking to
                        help out on questions extremely fast - by asking ChatGPT - and copy-pasting the response without
                        checking its truth, leading to misinformation spreading through the site.
                        <br /><br />
                        While the ban is great in theory, it's not that easy to detect - or wasn't, until <a
                            href="https://gptzero.substack.com/">GPTZero</a> arrived at the beginning of the year. It
                        has already received over 7 million views and can detect ChatGPT's writing style - using the
                        same technology that ChatGPT is built upon. It measures "perplexity" of the text - how random it
                        is. Humans tend to have a much higher score of perplexity, and the tool gives you statistical
                        information on the perplexity of sentences in the text before giving its verdict. This could be
                        very useful for stopping ai-plagiarism in education. "Plagiarism" of AI has been a controversial
                        subject recently, specifically pertaining to AI art, such as <a
                            href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">Dall-E 2</a> (also by OpenAI). While the art looks a lot
                        fantastic, several questions are under debate - whether the prompter or the AI made it, for a
                        start; and also the ethics of the training data used for the AI: should all artists whose images
                        were trained on be credited?
                        <br /><br />
                        ChatGPT is a showcase of great advancements in natural language AI, which has come extremely far
                        from when Alan Turing created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Imitation
                            Game</a> (aka Turing Test), to <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman">Eugene Goostman</a> passing it and
                        developing much more since then. However, many ethical issues arise from it that do need to be
                        adressed.
