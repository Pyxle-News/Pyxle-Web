                            ChatGPT is OpenAI’s new chatbot AI, trained to interact with users and give appropriate responses. However, this is not like your average chatbot. ChatGPT has been trained on incredibly large volumes on information, mostly from the Internet. This has given it in one of the most advanced and sophisticated models for handling input in the world. It was released in November 2022, and has since changed the Internet. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The way it works is a user or application provides the model with a prompt. Then, the AI responds with a suitable and appropriate response, trying its best to sound as human as possible. And often, it does the trick. The responses are well-written, and articulate, as if there was a real, really smart human sitting on the other end of the screen. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            At first glance, this is a major breakthrough for saving human time and resources. Where there used to be humans working on reports, journaling etc. now, AI can do the same in the blink of an eye, saving countless resources and freeing up time for humans to spend their time on more worthwhile and creative tasks. ChatGPT can also help write code and fix software bugs, adding to the growing list of jobs that will have to adapt.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            However, once you dig deeper, serious issues start to appear. Firstly, often, the responses are almost correct. For example, responses related to programming often contain small bugs and errors which can lead to more hours spent on finding them that could have been spent on writing the program from scratch anyway. This led to the banning of Stack Overflow (a popular site for asking programming related questions) responses which used ChatGPT in their generation. This was because the code ChatGPT would look correct at first look, but at a closer look, there was a multitude of errors. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            There was also the problem of ChatGPT generating illegal or illicit responses. Although the team at OpenAI (creators of ChatGPT) have implemented barriers and blocks to prevent such responses, it is worryingly easy to bypass these. These have led to responses from ChatGPT explaining to users how to hotwire a car, bully someone, blackmail etc.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            However the future of AI unfolds over the course of the next few years, there are always going to be advantages and disadvantages. Although ChatGPT may seem to be replacing human labourers, we should see it as a tool that multiplies human effort, and this is only the newest tool in our ever-expanding toolbox as a species.

                        <h2>iOS Sideloading to finally become a reality?</h2>

                            Since the very beginning of iOS, Apple has attempted to lock down all aspects of their products, software, and hardware. This is especially seen through their strict App Store regulations, with specific design requirements and stringent capability restrictions. But finally, after almost 15 years of Apple’s tight hold on the App Store, they are allegedly working on adding support for sideloading and alternate App Stores, likely for iOS 17’s release next year.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            But first, what is sideloading? Most android users will already be familiar with this term, which refers to being able to install standalone apps outside of the dedicated Play Store on your device. Historically, Apple has tried very hard to prevent users from sideloading apps aside from for development purposes. Hence, currently the only official way to sideload apps is using XCode on a computer which runs MacOS. Fortunately, opensource developers have been working hard as well over the last few years, with ground breaking tools such as AltStore and Sideloadly allowing even those without MacOS computers to sideload apps. Unfortunately, these come with a major caveat, with apps needing to be reinstalled every 7 days without a paid developer account. 

                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The only remaining question now, is why has Apple finally decided to give in? Well, this is in response to the recent changes in the EU Digital Markets Act, which went into effect in November earlier this year. The legislation states that “gatekeeper” companies such as Apple have until March 6, 2024 to open up their services and platforms to external companies and developers. As expected, Apple is not happy with this, and is likely to limit these easing of OS restrictions to the EU on release, citing concerns over user privacy and security as it becomes easier to sideload potentially malicious apps.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            In addition to this, the EU has also pushed laws to mandate USB-C on all devices with wired connectivity, including Apple’s iPhones. Now, whilst many feel this guarantees a USB-C iPhone, in reality it is likely that Apple is developing a completely port-less iPhone, with all functions including charging and data transfer taking place wirelessly. This would mean that Apple would not have to comply with the USB-C mandate in the EU, which is a very Apple-thing to do.

                            Firstly, programming language updates:

                             Rust is the new programming language that is promising to change the development world, and is undoubtedly doing so. Many credit it for being blazingly fast as well as memory safe, which helped contribute to it being ranked first in Stack Overflow’s 2022 “Most Loved” programming language survey.

                            Recently, ChatGPT has taken the internet by storm, being the new, fun AI that everyone is playing with. Whilst not perfect, it displays an astounding amount of “intelligence” being able to write (mediocre) essays, create simple programs as well as just have simple conversations with.

                            Github Copilot will soon be able to allow users to program using their voice. It uses an AI model developed by OpenAI called Codex. Currently, Copilot only supports Visual Studio, but work is being done for adding support to other IDEs.
